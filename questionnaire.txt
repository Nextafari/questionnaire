This is going to be a multichoice exam project
users will be able to answer questions and get rated according to their answers
users are meant to categorized based on their scores after taking the sample test or answering the 
questions asked an email is also meant to be sent to the admin of the website with respect to the users 
score and category they fall into


Actors and actions
user -- user is a human being taking the exam
User model == name, age, email, phone_number, marital_status, occupation, address,  postal_zip_code


category model==This will house the various categories a user falls into based on their average scores
The average scores will emante from using some factorials in the views to multiply the users individual
scores


category model = will be a one to one field with the user model, because a user can only be in one category
at a time, the category model will be a choice field that will be mapped to a user and displayed 
to them after they must have taken the tests


The question and scores should be saved in the database, and the calculation should be implemented from the
frontend whereby each questions score is saved on the browsers temporary storage like session and cookies
and then calculated once the user ends the session by clicking. This can also be implemented from the backend



There should be a model for answers and this will later be querried and compared to a set of rules using
conditional statements, and then the user can now be profiled based on their answer
